PROJECT DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains solutions to all 20 questions
from the CampusPe Python Basics Assignment.

Each program is written in Python and follows:

• Meaningful variable names
• Proper comments explaining logic
• Input validation using try-except
• Edge case handling
• Menu-driven programs where required
• Clean and readable structure

All programs were tested with multiple inputs before submission.
